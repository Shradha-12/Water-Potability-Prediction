# Water Potability Prediction

## Overview

Water potability is essential for ensuring safe drinking water. This project aims to predict the potability of water based on various chemical properties. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we can determine whether water is safe to drink.

## Features

- Predicts the potability of water using a trained machine learning model.
- Considers various chemical properties of water for prediction.
- Provides a detailed report on the findings and methodologies used.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes several features that describe the chemical properties of water. These features include:

- pH
- Hardness
- Solids
- Chloramines
- Sulfate
- Conductivity
- Organic carbon
- Trihalomethanes
- Turbidity

## Installation

To run this project locally, please follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shradha-12/Water-Potability-Prediction.git
   cd Water-Potability-Prediction
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the model and predict water potability:

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open the notebook file `Water_Potability_Prediction.ipynb` and execute the cells to see the predictions.

## Results

The results of the model, including accuracy, precision, and recall, are discussed in detail in the project report.
